# The Data Science Accelerator

### What?
The Data Science Accelerator is a **20h program**, which has the goal to deepen your knowledge of Python, Data Science & Machine Learning, as well as to give you a sneak peek into deep learning(AI) to accelerate your skills and to prepare you well for next semesters AI track.

Some of the topics you will encounter:
- Advanced Python Features
- How to use your tools effectively and how to write good code
- How to create great Data Visualisations
- Anomaly Detection
- More Machine Learning (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVMs)
- Regression with Deep Neural Networks
- Image Classification with Deep Neural Networks
- and much more!

If you want to know more also look at our [introduction](https://dsaccelerator.techlabs.org/introduction/welcome.html)

### How?
The data science accelerator will be focused on learning and practicing these learned skills with real-world problems. There won`t be a project phase, but many tasks that will require communication with the community and experimentation on your part. (You are, of course, always encouraged to collaborate with other learners!)

The program will also be **less** step-by-step than your previous program. It is more adapted to real-life problems and will require some thinking, research, and reading on your part. Are you up for the challenge?

### Who?
We open the program to students who have **received their certificate** and **finished their Data Science track 100%**
The program will include students from all locations, so you have the chance to meet Data Science learners from all over the world!
Some members of the Berlin team will manage the program.

### When?
The program is always open for applications. We designed the program that it can be finished in 6 weeks, spending one evening a week (roughly 3 hours). The program can be started anytime, but keep in mind that we run this program as an experiment, so don't expect it to run forever.
