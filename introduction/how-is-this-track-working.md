# How is this track working?
This accelerator operates a bit differently than your previous data science track. While the Digital Shaper Program combines learning on your own, a local community & practice in a group project; the accelerator only focuses on the community and practice, by introducing new concepts to combine those two even more. This page explains the differences between the two programs, as well as how the learning and your experience will differ.

## Previous Knowledge
While the Data Science Track does not require any knowledge, the accelerator builds on top of that knowledge. So if you have not finished your data science track 100% yet, we would advise going back and finishing these lessons.

Further, we expect some previous knowledge with Git, GitHub & the Terminal. We think you hopefully used all of this before in your group project, but if not here are our materials. **Please take your time, and learn these things, you will need it later in the track** If there are still any issues which google and our tutorials can't resolve please ask in Slack.

## Being a Digital Shaper
For us being a Digital Shaper means to use all available digital tools to their fullest and in an ethically appropriate manner. To give you an example: Most people nowadays are able to use Excel on a basic level. But even after working with it for years they never learned to use its full potential, often resulting in doing a lot of tasks manually for hours, which could be quickly automated. Being a Digital Shaper means that you know, that spending time upfront to learn how to automate things, will save you more time in the long term!

## Task
While our data science track had many step-by-step tasks, the focus for tasks in the accelerator is more adapted to real-life. This means that for some tasks we don't give the exact solution (such as the exact function call), and you need to search them for yourself with your search-engine of choice. Don't worry, we usually give you a good hint what to search for or you might have seen a similar function previously.

Additionally, for some tasks there are simply no `solutions = True`. We will sometimes ask you to share your opinion on certain topics, or ask you to come up with a problem/questions for a data set you found yourself. 

## Edyoucated
The track you need to select on Edyoucate is Data Science - Accelerator. If you can't see it reach out to your local Techlabs-chapter. 

Additionally, we also often added useful tips and content into the description of the Edyoucated material. You should start reading this content for the track!

## Extra Curricular Activty
We currently have some longer sections which are extra curricular activity. We don't expect you to do them, but if you do we will annotate this on your certificate.

Usually one extra curricular activity takes around 3h to complete, but some might take longer. Some might even be potentially limitless if your really fall in love with a topic.

## Time Commitment
Our Digital Shaper Program usually runs for 4-6 months with a time commitment around 6-10h per week. The accelerator on the other hand is designed for a 3-5h commitment for 6 weeks. 

## Timeline
While our usual Digital Shaper program has a fixed timeline, the accelerator has a more flexible approach. The accelerator focuses on the time between the semester, which is different for each location. The program is designed to be completed in 6 weeks in a more relaxed way. 

While the flexible timeline would allow you in theory to complete the program whenever you want, we have a fixed end-date for all participants in the end of April.

## Certificate
To receive your certificates fulfill the following criteria:
- Watch/Read all materials
- Complete all the tasks and submit them in their designated way
- Be active on Slack (in addition to task assignments)
- Finish your course 100%

## Community, Slack & Slack Etiquette
Most of our communication will be done through Slack, so make sure that you are in the right channel: TODO CHANNEL

We know that it is hard to achieve the community feeling in a remote-only program. This is where we ask you to actively participate in the Slack-channels and discussions. We also encourage you to suggest your own digital community solutions like digital coffee meetings etc.!

Just like working in reallife has an etiquette, we also think that one is required for communicating on Slack.  Unfortunatly, we think they are not as obvious as in real-life which is why we wrote them down here. Please take a minute and read them :)

## How to reach out for help!
It is completely normal to have questions during your learning journey.(It's even good, because it means you are really thinking about what you are consuming!) Often though, we get asked the same question multiple times. We would like to channel all questions and ask you to post them only into our Slack channel. Questions (that may concern others) asked to us via private message will simply be ignored.

## Events

We have not planned any events yet so far, but if you are interested to support us in this or even run your own event you are more then welcome to reach out to us! :) 


## Feedback

This is the first time we will run this program, and we rely completly on your feedback. If you have any ideas, improvments (such as better material) or anything to improve the program reach out to us!

But please also fill out our Feedback forms incooperated into the track :D
