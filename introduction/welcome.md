# Welcome to the Accelerator

**Hey Techies,**

We are happy that you are interested and joined our between-semester program. Now that you have finished your Digital Shaper projects, you have realized that developing data science solutions takes longer than expected and that you would like to become faster and improve your knowledge in data science. This is what the Data Science Accelerator is for, to accelerate your data science skills! The Data Science Accelerator will give you a deeper understanding of Python & Data Science, as well as a sneak peek for your next steps as a data scientist: Artificial Intelligence. 

Based on these goals, the track is separated into three parts:
1. Python Deep-Dive

   Data Science is like every craft: The better you know your tools, the faster and better are your results. The primary tool you will be using for data science will be Python and its various libraries, so learning more about them will accelerate your data science skills by quite a bit! This section won`t introduce Python; instead, we will build on your foundation and introduce more complex & powerful topics. 

2. Data Science Deep-Dive

   What is the second-best way of getting faster and better in data science after learning more about Python? The answer is *more* data science. As in the previous section, we will build on your existing skill-set and dive deeper into data science. While a big part of data science is about coding and models, we will also introduce more soft topics of data science, such as how to define a data science problem and how to communicate with your non-ds teammates.
   
3. Artificial Intelligence Sneak Peek
   
   While the differences are not always apparent, and many people (especially the ones who don`t know much about tech) will use them interchangeably, AI is nothing else than a subgroup of data science. You feed a model some data, and it will be able to predict some output. To give you a better insight that this is not magic or only reserved for computer science PhDs, we will provide you with a sneak peek into the whole field and our AI track. 




Before you start learning the real material, please go through our introduction documents to get into the right mindset to see the difference between the digital shaper program and the accelerator and how to set up your working environment.

We hope you have a great time!

Merlin, Max & Zubin!
